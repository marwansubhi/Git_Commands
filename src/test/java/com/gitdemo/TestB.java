/*
* First when we write into th terminal we have to run the "git status" command
* we will see some file that are in red and need to be added
* run the "git add filename" command to add the file to the staging area
* run the "git commit -m "message"" command to commit the changes
* run the "git push" command and provide username and password of git hub account
* make some changes from the remote repo , commit and add some message
* run the "git fetch" command
* run the "git pull command" and you should be able to see the changes
* make changes on more than one file
* run the "git add ." command which adds all the changes that happening at once, so we dont need to specify the folder name
* run the (git commit -am "message") command to commit all the changes we did in all the files
* and lastly push with providing username and password of github account
*Thank you for your time
*this is cool
* thanks
